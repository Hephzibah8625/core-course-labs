## Framework

**Flask**

I used flask because of its simplicity, flexibility, and documentation. With flask, you can easily dynamically define text, build APIs, and handle user input, making it an excellent choice for scalable and maintainable web applications

##  Libraries

**Pytz**

 I used pytz due to its comprehensive database of time zone information and its ease of use. With pytz, you can accurately convert and manipulate dates and times across different time zones, ensuring consistent and correct time-related operations in your applications

**Flake8**

Flake8 is considered one of the best Python linters for code quality, style consistency, and the ability to catch potential errors, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code

**Pytest**

Pytest is considered the best testing framework for Python because of its simplicity, powerful features, extensive plugin ecosystem, and efficient test discovery, making it a popular choice for writing and executing tests in Python projects
